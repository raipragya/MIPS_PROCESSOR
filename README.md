# MIPS_PROCESSOR

1. In this project I have designed a MIPS processor to implement the following programs:

  • Sum of squares of digits of a number.
  • Factorial of a number.
  • Maximum element of an array.

2. MARS simulator is used as our assembler.
  
3.The code is structured according to the different stages of the MIPS processor.
