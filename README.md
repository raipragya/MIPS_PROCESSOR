# MIPS_PROCESSOR

1. In this project I have designed a MIPS processor to implement the following programs:

  • Sum of squares of digits of a number.
  • Factorial of a number.
  • Maximum element of an array.

2. MARS simulator is used as our assembler.
  
3.The code is structured according to the different stages(INSTRUCTION FETCH(IF), INSTRUCTION DECODE(ID),EXECUTION STAGE AND MEMORY STAGE) of the MIPS processor.

RUN THE PROGRAM
4.Clone the repository and run processor.py being in your root directory.(You need to have python installed)
